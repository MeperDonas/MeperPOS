## Repository structure

```
gestion-inventario-app/
├── backend/    # NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL REST API (port 3001)
└── frontend/   # Next.js App Router SPA (port 3000)
```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version compatible with Next.js 16 and NestJS 11).
- **npm** (bundled with Node.js).
- **PostgreSQL** running, with a database created for the project.

## Getting started

### 1. Database

Create the database in PostgreSQL, for example `inventario_db`.

### 2. Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # or create the .env file manually (see variables)
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run seed
npm run start:dev
```

Backend environment variables (`.env`):

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:admin123@localhost:5432/inventario_db"
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
PORT=3001
CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000"
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="..."
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="..."
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="..."
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3001/api`.

### 3. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend environment variables (`.env.local`):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Roles and permissions

The system distinguishes between the global `SUPER_ADMIN` role (system administrator) and per-organization roles (`OrgRole`): `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, `MEMBER`, `CASHIER`, and `INVENTORY_USER`. Per-organization roles inherit permissions: `OWNER` inherits the permissions of `ADMIN`, `MEMBER`, and `CASHIER`; `ADMIN` inherits from `MEMBER` and `CASHIER`; `MEMBER` inherits from `CASHIER`. Route access is enforced both on the backend (guards and decorators) and on the frontend (`DashboardLayout` and the route-role map).

## Architecture

A web application composed of a REST API (NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL) and an SPA (Next.js App Router) that consumes the API through an Axios client with automatic JWT injection and redirects on `401` responses.

The backend is multi-tenant: each organization isolates its data, with its own sequence numbering, per-organization roles, and limits based on the contracted plan. Authentication uses JWT with refresh tokens; the frontend stores the token in `localStorage`. All endpoints are prefixed with `/api` and DTOs are validated with `class-validator` through a global `ValidationPipe`.
